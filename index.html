          In the beginning, there was nothing. There was no space or time. Everything we that exits today was concentrated in an infinitely small and dense point known as a singularity...

          About 13.8 billion years ago, that singularity exploded. A violent and extremely rapid expansion began. This is what we call the Big Bang. In fractions of a second, the universe inflated exponentially in a period called inflation. Gradually, it began to cool enough for energy to be transformed into particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons. In the first few minutes, the nuclei of the simplest atomsâ€”hydrogen, helium, and traces of lithium, were formed...

          Over time, the expansion continued and the universe cooled further. Around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, electrons and nuclei combined to form atoms, allowing light to travel freely. That ancient light is what we still detect today as the comic microwave backgorund. Over billions of years, gravity pulled matter together to form gas clouds, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and eventually planetary systems, and on one of those planets, life.
