# MEDP33100 - Project 1 Interactive Storytelling

## Live Demo

- [Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on GitHub Pages.](https://pedrotroncoso28.github.io/project1/)

## Project Overview

- For this project, I set out to create an educational and engaging website about the Big Bang. The narrative is based on the scientific theory of how the universe we inhabit was formed. For my website, I set a goal to keep the user engaged throughout the short story. To achieve this, I designed the website so that users can click on interactive dots, each revealing a different part of the story. Also, I believe the strongest aspect of the website is that the last of these dots triggers a simulation of the Big Bang through animations. In this way, the project not only illustrates the most important moment of the story but also entertains users visually.

## Figma Design

- [Provide a link to the Figma design of the webpage.](https://www.figma.com/design/YLuFqqEHtCFyddKYc32Ss8/MEDP-33100---Project-1-Designs--Copy-?node-id=0-1&t=kx4LNrCbhXqfq4JG-1)

## Features

- Animations
Dots grow slightly on hover.
Arrows next to the dots are animated with a subtle back-and-forth movement.
Stars and galaxies move outward from the center using the custom spread keyframe animation.
The last dot shakes when clicked (shake keyframes) before triggering the Big Bang simulation.
The effect of the explosion expands drastically from the center to its surroundings (explosion keyframes) to simulate the Big Bang.
I dynamically used JavaScript to generate stars and galaxies in the Big Bang simulation with random positions and sizes, giving the universe a natural and varied look.

- Sounds:
When a user clicks on a dot, the corresponding text is not only displayed but also read aloud using the browser's Speech Synthesis API. In addition, during the Big Bang simulation, I included the main theme from the film Interstellar, composed by Hans Zimmer. These tools add an engaging audit element to the learning experience.

- User-triggered Events
Users can click on small white dots along the timeline to reveal different parts of the Big Bang story. Each dot displays text that explains a stage in the formation of the universe.

- Responsive Design
On tablets and mobile devices, the timeline adapts:
Dots are centralized vertically and texts are displayed below each dot for better readability.
Fonts and dots sizes adjust for small screens.

## Technologies Used

- List of the technologies and tools used in this project:
    - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages
    - GitHub Pages for hosting and Figma for design

## Credits

- This project has been a real challenge for me, and I relied on several online resources to help me along the way. First, the class recording of Professor Dora Do working with JavaScript was very helpful. I also used the W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com) website extensively to learn new techniques in CSS and JavaScript. In addition, I reviewed the HTML cheatsheet (https://htmlcheatsheet.com) that the professor had provided in class to identify which tools could help me bring my ideas to life. I also watched several YouTube videos that supported my work on this project; One in particular, from the channel DesignWithArash (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwiX0oASlEw), was especially useful for designing my website in Figma. In this way, I created a responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- Regarding the images, I used Google Images to find pictures of galaxies, which I then edited and converted into PNG format by using Photoshop. Finally, as I mentioned before, I included the main theme from the film Interstellar, composed by Hans Zimmer to give a pleasant tone to my website.

## Future Enhancements

- If I had more time, I would have liked to add our home galaxy, The Milky Way, to the simulation. Here, when the user clicks on it, it would take them inside the galaxy and show them our solar system with some interesting animations and details.

- Also, I would have liked to work even more on the animation of the Big Bang simulation. I feel I can still make it much more realistic and engaging for the user experience.
